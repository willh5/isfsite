friday notes:

-frontend mostly set up, serving but not compiling css files
-on new computer , set up a local clone of app - wont have to deal with this static file stuff
will be worthwhile while learning react and getting comfortable with the new
structure of how css is served and updated, should make the PA case obvious

With that in mind, just follow same docs & that demo videow
